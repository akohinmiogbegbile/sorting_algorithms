# Sorting Algorithms & Big O

This repository provides an overview of various sorting algorithms and their respective Big O complexities. Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are essential for efficiently arranging elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Understanding the time complexity (Big O notation) of these algorithms is crucial for assessing their efficiency and applicability in different scenarios.

## Sorting Algorithms

In this repository, you will find implementations and explanations of the following sorting algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort**: Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Selection Sort**: Selection sort sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and swapping it with the first unsorted element.

3. **Insertion Sort**: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking up the next unsorted element and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part.

4. **Merge Sort**: Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves to produce a sorted output.

5. **Quick Sort**: Quick sort is another divide and conquer algorithm that picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot, recursively sorting the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot.

6. **Heap Sort**: Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements in ascending or descending order.

## Big O Notation

For each sorting algorithm, we provide a detailed explanation of its time complexity using Big O notation. Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the upper bound or worst-case scenario of the time complexity of an algorithm. Understanding Big O is vital for comparing the efficiency of sorting algorithms and choosing the most appropriate one for a specific use case.
